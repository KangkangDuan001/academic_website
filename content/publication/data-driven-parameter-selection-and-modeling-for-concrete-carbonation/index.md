abstract: "Concrete carbonation is known as a stochastic process. Its
  uncertainties mainly result from parameters that are not considered in
  prediction models. Parameter selection, therefore, is important. In this
  paper, based on 8204 sets of data, statistical methods and machine learning
  techniques were applied to choose appropriate influence factors in terms of
  three aspects: (1) the correlation between factors and concrete carbonation;
  (2) factors' influence on the uncertainties of carbonation depth; and (3) the
  correlation between factors. Both single parameters and parameter groups were
  evaluated quantitatively. The results showed that compressive strength had the
  highest correlation with carbonation depth and that using the aggregate-cement
  ratio as the parameter significantly reduced the dispersion of carbonation
  depth to a low level. Machine learning models manifested that selected
  parameter groups had a large potential in improving the performance of models
  with fewer parameters. This paper also developed machine learning carbonation
  models and simplified them to propose a practical model. The results showed
  that this concise model had a high accuracy on both accelerated and natural
  carbonation test datasets. For natural carbonation datasets, the mean absolute
  error of the practical model was 1.56 mm."
