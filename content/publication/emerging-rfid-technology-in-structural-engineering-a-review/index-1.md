abstract: This paper conducted experimental tests and theoretical analyses to
  present a comprehensive study on the shear behavior of dry-connected steel
  plate frame-reinforced brick walls. One unreinforced brick wall, one brick
  wall reinforced with steel strips, and four brick walls reinforced with
  dry-connected steel plate frames were fabricated for shear compression tests.
  Experimental tests showed that steel plate frames effectively improved the
  bearing capacity and stiffness of masonry structures and impeded cracking. As
  expected, enhancing the steel plate thickness and vertical load boosted the
  peak load and axial stiffness of steel frame-reinforced structures but also
  reduced the ductility. Numerical simulation accurately predicted the peak
  load, crack development, and crushing area of the specimens. In addition,
  based on the buckling theory of steel plates and the existing calculation
  theory of masonry, this paper also proposed formulas for determining the
  bearing capacity of composite walls. The calculations of the formulas
  exhibited high accuracy in comparison with the experimental results.
