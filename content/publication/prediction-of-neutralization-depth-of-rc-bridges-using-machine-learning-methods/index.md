abstract: Machine learning techniques have become a popular solution to
  prediction problems. These approaches show excellent performance without being
  explicitly programmed. In this paper, 448 sets of data were collected to
  predict the neutralization depth of concrete bridges in China. Random forest
  was used for parameter selection. Besides this, four machine learning methods,
  such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and XGBoost,
  were adopted to develop models. The results show that machine learning models
  obtain a high accuracy (>80%) and an acceptable macro recall rate (>80%) even
  with only four parameters. For SVM models, the radial basis function has a
  better performance than other kernel functions. The radial basis kernel SVM
  method has the highest verification accuracy (91%) and the highest macro
  recall rate (86%). Besides this, the preference of different methods is
  revealed in this study.
