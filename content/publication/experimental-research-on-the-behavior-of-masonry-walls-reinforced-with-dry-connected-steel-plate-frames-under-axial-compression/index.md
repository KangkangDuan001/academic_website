abstract: This paper conducted several experimental tests and theoretical
  analyses to present a comprehensive study on the behavior of dry-connected
  steel plate frame-reinforced brick walls under axial compression. One
  unreinforced brick wall, two brick walls reinforced with dry-connected steel
  plate frame, and one brick wall reinforced with steel strips were fabricated
  for axial compression tests. The experiments generally showed that steel plate
  frames effectively improved the structure's bearing capacity and axial
  stiffness and impeded its cracking. Increasing the thickness of steel plates
  further improved the bearing capacity but undermined the ductility of the
  composite wall. Besides, based on the buckling theory of steel plate and the
  existing calculation theory of masonry strength, this paper also proposed
  formulas for determining the bearing capacity of the composite wall. The
  calculations of formulas exhibited acceptable accuracy in comparison with the
  experimental results.
