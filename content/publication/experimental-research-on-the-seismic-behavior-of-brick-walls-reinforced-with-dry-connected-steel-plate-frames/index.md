abstract: Currently, the seismic performance of masonry buildings needs to be
  improved due to their weak earthquake-resistant constructional measures. In
  this paper, a new method for integrally strengthening masonry walls by steel
  frames connected through bolts and welds was proposed. To investigate their
  seismic behavior, one unreinforced brick wall and four reinforced brick walls
  were fabricated for tests. The main parameters were the thickness of steel
  plates (3mm vs. 5mm vs. 8mm) and loading methods (reversed cyclic loading vs.
  monotonous loading). Experimental tests showed that the reinforcement method
  effectively improved the seismic performance of brick walls, especially the
  bearing capacity, ductility, and energy consumption. Increasing the thickness
  of steel plates effectively improved the ductility of brick walls. It is noted
  that the failure of the structure changed from shear failure to bending-shear
  failure due to the constraint caused by steel frames. The reinforced walls
  under reversed cyclic loading and monotonic loading exhibited similar failure
  modes, and the ductility of structures under monotonic loading was better.
