abstract: "Radio frequency identification (RFID) has become a hot topic in
  structural engineering. It has an immense potential in promoting the
  intelligence of construction, changing the traditional way of detection,
  optimizing the usage of building. Especially during the last ten years, the
  number of publications focus on this technology has increased dramatically. In
  this paper, we presented a literature review of articles which focus on the
  applications of RFID in structural engineering. According to the different
  effects of RFID in different stages of the lifecycle of a building, we
  organized these applications into three main categories: intelligent
  construction, structural health monitoring (SHM) and intelligent management
  and operation. The basic theory of RFID technology, the tendency and status of
  current researches were discussed in this paper. Finally, the gap and latent
  improvement of existing applications in each category were proposed. It is
  hoped that our analysis of these researches will provide meaningful
  information on the comprehension of the applications of RFID in structural
  engineering."
